  - Error messages in page work now (output is now buffered before response
  is sent)
  - Tables will now show "no results..." message when there are no results

Re-tooling of the application. Several things fixed:
  - Style has been fixed and looks a lot better and is more functional.
  - Most content has been moved to an index page in the application root.
  - Deprecated header templating and what not in the python script,
  aws-info.py now is mainly just the table/accordion renderer.
  - index.html page now will dynamically load the content and will give a
  "waiting..." type message while the script is being called.
  - Proper handling of error situations for the above and the python script
  are currently a WIP, and you may get a WSOD on the bottom if the script
  fails, or partial content.
  - Finally, cleaned up jQuery UI content and removed unnecessary files.
